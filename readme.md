# Typing Settings
Originally by Abdallah hayder, the Typing Settings add-on provides several options to enhance the typing experience on the keyboard through its features. These features include enabling sound effects when typing in text fields, activating or deactivating speak characters through three modes: off, speak characters only in text fields, or speak characters anywhere, including words. It also allows enabling or disabling speak passwords when typing in password fields.

# Difference between fork and original
This fork (using original code from Abdallah hayder, code from Bryn's fork, as well as code written specifically for this fork by Bryn and I) features the following changes:
* Adds the volume control for the typing sounds to the settings.
*Adds the option to pan typing sounds to the settings.
* Adds the option to settings, and a new input gesture (assigned to NVDA+Alt+2 by default) to cycle between typing sound playback modes: off, everywhere, and in edit boxes.
* Switches to Sound_lib, fixing the lag partially
* Typing sounds do not interrupt anymore.
